                <p>This article explains how to get yourself certified from the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and the reason why I did so.</p>
                <img class="rounded mx-auto d-block" src="{% static "images/tf_badge.png" %}" alt="tensorflow_badge">
                <p>As mentioned in the title, I’ll split this article into two main sections — <strong>WHY</strong> and <strong>HOW</strong>.</p>
                <p class="resume-section section-title">WHY :</p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Why do I need to take this ?</p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Is it worth spending time on this ?</p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Will this add any value to my profile ?</p>
                <p>If you’re having similar doubts in mind, let me give you my answer for the above.</p>
                <p>Short version of the answer is — <strong>self-confidence</strong> and <strong>motivation</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Let me explain :-</strong></p>
                <p>I have been learning ML and DL for ~1.5 years and I know how different ML and DL algorithms work . Let’s consider this as foundational knowledge. But keep in mind that this is not by watching random YouTube videos or taking some quick ML Bootcamps which promises you to learn ML overnight (LoL). I got the foundations by following best-in-class books and lectures by pioneers in this field (will give some links below). So that takes care of foundations and what next ? Well, I’m also working full-time on ML and DL for ~1 year.</p>
                <p>After all this, I’m not satisfied with my skills though my colleagues praise my in-depth knowledge of these ML/DL models, thought process for solving use-cases etc . After careful introspection I found that due to my enthusiasm towards this amazing field, my inner self is pushing me to learn something new all the time by subconsciously convincing me that I don’t know anything. So I just wanted to validate myself to bring my morale up. Then I decided to take an exam that tests my ML skills and I chose this TensorFlow Developer certification exam.</p>
                <p>Just to reiterate, I wanted to evaluate my skills to make sure that I’m in correct path of learning which is WHY I took this exam.</p>
                <p>So now I have a clear idea <strong><em>WHY</em></strong>&nbsp I should take this exam, let’s jump into <strong><em>HOW</em></strong>&nbsp I cleared it !</p>
                <p class="resume-section section-title">HOW :</p>
                <p>In this section, I’ll explain what a novice and decently experienced folks(me included) should be knowing before they start preparing for this exam. Then I’ll explain about the exam itself.</p>
                <h5>1. For Novice :</h5>
                <p>If you’re someone just starting out, make sure your basics are in place and this includes getting familiar with jargon, ML paradigm, what comes in and what goes out for different models etc. Below are some good references to start with.</p>
                <p>There is a great course by Andrew Ng which starts with complete basics of ML and explains some important algorithms. If you want a completion certificate,<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"> here’s</a> the Coursera link and if you want to watch all of them for free (like me),<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN"> here’s</a> the link for the entire course playlist. The knowledge that you got here won’t be tested in TensorFlow exam, but this is a great starting point to get into ML/DL world.</p>
                <p>After this course, I’d recommend a great book which gives a general sense of many ML/DL architectures and how to apply them practically. That wonderful book is ‘‘ Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow ’’ by ‘Aurélien Géron’ and <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87"> here’s</a> the amazon link to purchase. This book is exceptionally great in explaining the practical aspects of applied ML/DL and you won’t regret purchasing this. Note that only chapters 10–16 will be relevant for the exam.</p>
                <p>Alongside this book, you can start with DeepLearning. One of the best introductory lectures to DL is by MIT and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI">here’s</a> the link (it has 2021 edition too) and only first 3 videos are relevant for the exam but I suggest to go through all so that you’ll know various aspects and problems in DL. To get in-depth intuition of almost all important DL architectures there’s an excellent specialization by Andrew Ng. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Here’s</a> the Coursera link and this has been updated recently with latest advancements across different domains.</p>
                <p>After following the above references, you’ll be in a comfortable position to take this certification.</p>
                <h5>2. Folks with decent experience :</h5>
                <p>If you consider yourself as experienced in this field, there are some checkboxes to consider before preparing for this exam. You should be at least familiar with inner workings of various DL architectures like Dense Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and why these work for the respective domains.</p>
                <p>Also make sure you knew the topics that I mentioned in above section.</p>
                <h5>3. Preparation for the actual exam :</h5>
                <p>This is a 5-hour long hands-on coding exam and all the details of the exam can be found <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate">here</a>.</p>
                <p>First checkout the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf">‘Candidate Handbook’</a> so that you’ll know what this exam expects from you. TensorFlow team itself recommends <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice">TensorFlow in Practice specialization</a> which focuses on using TensorFlow to solve some real world problems across Vision, NLP and Time Series domains. I encourage you to go through each and every detail of that specialization and play with different models.</p>
                <p>You should be having a good understanding of all knobs in tuning a neural network like — What to do to increase accuracy of model, How to reduce the fluctuations in validation loss etc as these skills will be tested in this exam.</p>
                <p>One more thing is you’ll be taking this exam in <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> IDE. So make sure you practice at least couple of exercises in this IDE to make yourself familiar with it. If your PC is not powerful enough to train 5 neural networks in 5 hours, consider renting a GPU VM in GCP/AWS or at least use Google Colab to train the model, download and keep it in respective directory which the exam environment expects and then submit.</p>
                <p>That covers everything you should know to get certified as a TensorFlow Developer. Now I’ll share my experience with this exam.</p>
                <p class="resume-section section-title">My Experience and Feedback :</p>
                <p>I took <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice">TensorFlow in Practice specialization</a> in August 2020 but I didn’t think of taking an actual exam. But after ~8 months, for some obvious reasons mentioned in <strong>“WHY”</strong> section, I want to take this certification.</p>
                <p>First I reviewed the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/site-assets/downloads/marketing/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf">handbook</a> and I was pretty familiar with all the sections. So I decided it won’t take much time for me to prepare for this exam and then I reviewed <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/Setting_Up_TF_Developer_Certificate_Exam.pdf">‘Setting up environment for the exam’</a> which you’ll get in handbook itself. Then I decided that my laptop is not capable enough to train these neural nets in time and I don’t want to take a chance by continuing with by laptop for the exam.</p>
                <p>So I created an account in <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and configured a <em>g4dn-2x-large</em> which will have NVIDIA Tesla T4 with 8 VCPUs. I cannot continue with default command line interface as I have to take exam in PyCharm. So I installed a GUI for the Linux machine, installed python-3.8.0 as mentioned in handbook and installed PyCharm in it.
                <p>Now the environment is ready and I decided to review all exercises in ‘TensorFlow in Practice’ specialization real quick. As mentioned earlier, I have good experience using TensorFlow, training models and controlling training metrics so I swiftly went through all exercises in the specialization in a couple of days and tested my GPU in AWS a day before the exam just to make sure everything is working as expected.</p>
                <p>I’m all set and ready to take the exam. I went to TensorFlow Certification homepage and clicked on ‘Begin Exam’ and then I got redirected to <a href="https://app.trueability.com/">TrueAbility portal</a>. I submitted my identity proof and a picture as part of a validation process and paid $100. Soon after that, my TrueAbility homepage is populated with some exam related info. I clicked on <strong>‘REDEEM’</strong> and after 20–30 seconds, I got some instructions regarding installation of ‘TensorFlow Exam’ plugin in PyCharm. I knew this prior to the payment(mentioned in handbook) and already installed it. Also I made sure to use same Gmail for logging in to TrueAbility portal and ‘TensorFlow Plugin’ in PyCharm.</p>
                <p>I clicked on ‘Begin Exam’ button at top right in PyCharm and gave python-3.8.0 path to python interpreter (this is the version that the exam is tested by the time I took it) and after that a virtual environment will get created with necessary packages for the exam. You can install any other packages also if you want. From that moment, exam is <strong>STARTED</strong> and I had 5 hours to complete.</p>
                <p>Questions will be in the increasing order of difficulty and you can ‘submit and test’ each question any number of times which will show an instant score out of 5 for the submitted model. I started with the first and easiest question. I built, trained my model and submitted it for the score. Guess what happened…? I got 0/5 for this model which is the easiest of all and this hurt my ego &#128540; . I tested it with some data and figured out that it’s not converging properly. After some changes and training for a bit longer, I got 5/5.</p>
                <p>After solving the first question, I got familiar with the exam environment and available options and stuff. Thereafter I solved all the remaining 4 questions. For 3 of them I got 5/5 in first attempt and for 1 I got 3/5. Again, I know what to do to improve it even further so I made respective changes and I got 5/5 for that as well.</p>
                <p>I got 5/5 for all the questions and reviewed the scripts again. Can you guess how much time is still left when I’m submitting the test…? May be 1 hour or max 2? Nope, you’re wrong. I still had 3 hours and 9 minutes by the time I’m submitting the exam! Now I can say that I aced this test. But don’t get me wrong and I’m not saying it’s the easiest exam for all. Difficulty ranges from person to person and this exam is not the easiest one which you can pass with very basic knowledge.</p>
                <p>The main reason I completed this test swiftly is because I have the experience, and I KNOW how changing a particular knob will change the performance of the model and I had perfect setup (GPU) which is also very important.</p>
                <p>Right after the exam, I got a mail stating that I passed the exam and asked to fill out a form to get myself added to TensorFlow Certification Network. You can check out my certificate <a href="https://www.credential.net/842c62f5-3f3b-43f4-bde4-6c2fc96f87bc">here</a>.</p>
                <p>More importantly than the certificate, I gained <strong><em>self-confidence</em></strong> that I’m in the correct learning path and <strong><em>motivation</em></strong> to explore and learn further  &#128522;</p>
